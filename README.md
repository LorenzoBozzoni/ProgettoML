# Banks loan default prediction
I used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset?resource=download) Kaggle dataset. 

Banks earn a major revenue from lending loans.  But it is often associated with risk.  The borrowerâ€™s may default on the loan. To mitigate this issue, the banks have decided to use Machine Learning to overcome this issue.  They 
have collected past data on the loan borrowers & would like you to develop a strong ML Model to classify if any new borrower is likely to default or not.

## What has been done
In this project, done as a final assignment for the "Introduzione all'intelligenza artificiale" course @ Unipr, I've implemented many different models to address a binary classification problem. In particular i've used:
- logistic regression
- decision tree classifier
- adaboost classifier
- gradient boosting classifier
- bagging classifier
- basic neural network

## Understand the code
To better understand the whole project please consider reading the associated notes.


Small note: since it was my first "real-world scenario" ML project many things could have been done better but i still reached good results and learned a lot.
